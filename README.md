# home-assistant
I will be organizing my ideas for my home-assistant build out.
I am new to coding. I will be using a Raspberry Pi 4. My first goal is to install HACs.
I added File editor to my HA installation. I customized my HA configuration to:

homeassistant:
  name: 16 Cedros
  latitude: 36.6777
  longitude: -121.6555
  unit_system: imperial
  time_zone: America/Los_Angeles

HACS Installation
Created custom_components folder in /config
